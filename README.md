# Dictionary simulation

This project aims to use the skills acquired in the "Datastructures" and "Imperative programming 2" courses in an application framework simulating a dictionary.
## Our project does the following:

        1. Loads the dictionary in a binary search tree
        2. Searches if a word exists in the dictionary
        3. Prints the synonyms of a given word
        4. Adds words with their synonyms to the dictionary
        5. Prints the word with the most synonyms
        6. Prints the words for which a given word is a synonym
        7. Prints the most repeated synonym in the dictionary
        8. Checks if the binary search tree is balanced
        9. View recent search history

## To run the project:

    • Access the folder named (Final Project).
    • double click the executable file named (I2206.exe) (Warning: If the program crashes on start, delete the fileNewDictionary.txt then rerun the program!)
## The folder also contains the following files:
    • “main.c” where our functions are called and the user interface made,
    • “functions.c” where all the functions are implemented.
    • “functions.h” contains the header functions and structs.
    • “I2206.cbp” where the whole project is stored.
    • “WordsSynonyms.txt” is the text file we were provided with, that contains the dictionary.
    • “NewDictionary.txt” is the text file where we store the dictionary in alphabetical order and include it next time we run the program.
    • “AddedSynonyms.txt” contains the words and synonyms added by the user to the dictionary.
    • “history.txt” which stores the words we searched for previously.
